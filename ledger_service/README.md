# Ledger Service

`no_std` compatible implementation of the business logic of a
[`Ledger`](../third_party/federated_compute/federated-compute/fcp/protos/confidentialcompute/ledger.proto)
service that ensures blob access is subject to an access policy.

See the [`ledger_enclave_app`](../ledger_enclave_app) directory for additional
documentation.
