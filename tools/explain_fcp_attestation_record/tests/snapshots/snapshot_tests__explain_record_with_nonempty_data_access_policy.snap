== LEDGER / KMS ATTESTATION EVIDENCE ===
========================================

Oak Restricted Kernel Stack in a AMD SEV-SNP TEE

_____ Root Layer _____

The attestation is rooted in an AMD SEV-SNP TEE.

Attestations identifying the firmware captured in the evidence can be found here:
https://search.sigstore.dev/?hash=04e9cf2132fd633c9ccdc74688b0ec9195cd6d95af33c6b168af07059f718db8

ⓘ The firmware attestation digest is the SHA2-256 hash of the SHA2-384 hash of the initial memory state taken by the AMD SoC. The original SHA2-384 hash of the initial memory is: SHA2-384:306c9215737ba0da4cc5d16b655b9c9d66fd17d20cba4722bc2c339b1b0b90a61dd1fe781c91fa7a1ef0da45d1195d52; it is listed as the 'initial_measurement' in the evidence of this layer.

========================================
========== DATA ACCESS POLICY ==========
========================================

The data access policy allows 3 data transformations and defines 2 shared access budgets.

>>>>> Transform #0 <<<<<
Source blob ID: 0

Access budgets: the transform's access to its source blob is gated by *all* of the following access rules:
- limited access budget (at most 2 times): the transform may only access its source blob this many times.
- limited shared access budget #1 (at most 2 times): this and other transforms sharing this same budget may only access their source blobs this many times combined.

Application matcher for this transform:
- Tag: app2
- Binary configuration restrictions:
  StructMatcher { fields: [FieldMatcher { path: "field_a", matcher: Some(ValueMatcher { kind: Some(NumberValue(NumberMatcher { kind: Some(Eq(1234.0)) })) }) }] }
- Applications performing this transform must provide attestation evidence that can be verified with the following reference values:

Reference values for the Oak Restricted Kernel stack
_____ Root Layer _____

The attestation must be rooted in an AMD SEV-SNP TEE.

The reference values describing this layer are printed below.

amd_sev:
  allow_debug: false
  milan:

      boot_loader: 1
      fmc: 0
      microcode: 4
      snp: 3
      tee: 2
  stage0:
    skip: {}

_____ Application Layer _____

Note: we don't print sigstore.dev links for the binary digests in this list of reference values. You can construct such links manually using the following template: https://search.sigstore.dev/?hash=${SHA2_256_HASH}. For the root layer stage0 binary the reference value will list the SHA2-384 hash, in which case the SHA2-256 hash of that SHA2-384 hash should be used for the sigstore.dev lookup.

>>>>> Transform #1 <<<<<
Source blob ID: 0

Access budgets: the transform's access to its source blob is gated by *all* of the following access rules:
- limited shared access budget #1 (at most 2 times): this and other transforms sharing this same budget may only access their source blobs this many times combined.

Application matcher for this transform:
- Tag: app2
- Binary configuration restrictions:
  StructMatcher { fields: [FieldMatcher { path: "field_b", matcher: Some(ValueMatcher { kind: Some(NumberValue(NumberMatcher { kind: Some(Eq(5678.0)) })) }) }] }
- Applications performing this transform must provide attestation evidence that can be verified with the following reference values:

>>>>> Transform #2 <<<<<
Source blob ID: 1

Access budgets: the transform's access to its source blob is gated by *all* of the following access rules:
- limited shared access budget #0 (at most 5 times): this and other transforms sharing this same budget may only access their source blobs this many times combined.

Application matcher for this transform:
- Tag: app3
- Any application can perform this transform (attestation evidence will not be verified).
