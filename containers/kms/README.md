# CFC KMS

The Confidential Federated Compute Key Management Service (CFC KMS) manages keys
for uploading private data and processing that data using pipelines of TEEs. It
also manages rollback-protected privacy-sensitive state for those pipelines.

This is an in-development component that is intended to eventually replace
`//ledger_enclave_app`.
