# Minimum container with Pytorch and CUDA support

This is an experimental container only for exploration and testing purpose.
The final oci_runtime_bundle is entirely built with bazel.
Pip dependencies are pinned to specific version, and the packages installed via apt
are installed from a debian snapshot.
